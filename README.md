# Versatile Percentiles
## Fast, Efficient Latency Computations

### Motivation 

This project explores the t-digest data structure, introduced by Ted Dunning (repo here: https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest). 

The t-digest data structure stores a compressed version of a collection of 1-D data. The structure allows for fast computation of percentiles and is mergeable, allowing for natural parallel computations on a platform like Spark.
